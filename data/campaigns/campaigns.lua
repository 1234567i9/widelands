Though at the end of his glorious reign, Chat’Karuth chose his eldest son, Thron, to succeed him as the tribe’s warlord – a decision that left his two brothers unsatisfied. The old warlord knew that. As his father instructed him, Thron left the capital of Al’thunran, the home of the Throne Among the Trees, and withdrew his forces to the high hills where he buried the corpse of his father. There he swore to the gods and his father’s spirit that he’d return to re-established order. While his brothers have raged blind war against Thron and the few forces he left to secure the borders of Al’thunran, the young warlord seeks to reunite his ambitious brothers and force the tribes to march once again under a common banner.",

He began to feel safer and his army began to drop their attention off the potential enemy. That was their undoing.
